# ConveyanceCalculator
Me making a basic Conveyance Calculator for a friend

To run this in Docker:

`docker build -t html-server-image:v1 .` (you can call the tag something else if you want, like `docker build -t coolStuffHere:latest` )

`docker run -d -p 80:80 html-server-image:v1` (replace `html-server-image:v1` with the tag name you used if you gave it your own.)
